        <p>A programming language is a notation for writing <a href="#">programs</a>, which are specifications of a computation or <a href="#">algorithm</a>. Some authors restrict the term "programming language" to those languages that can express all possible algorithms. Traits often considered important for what constitutes a programming language include:</p>
        
        <h3>Function and target</h3>
        <p>A<span class="bold-italic"> computer programming language</span> is a language used to write computer programs, which involves a computer performing some kind of computation or algorithm and possibly control external devices such as printers, disk drives, robots, and so on. For example, <a href="#">PostScript programs</a> are frequently created by another program to control a computer printer or display. More generally, a programming language may describe computation on some, possibly abstract, machine. It is generally accepted that a <span class="bold-italic">complete specification</span> for a programming language includes a description, possibly idealized, of a machine or processor for that language. In most practical contexts, a programming language involves a computer; consequently, programming languages are usually defined and studied this way. <span class="highlight">Programming languages differ from natural languages in that natural languages are only used for interaction between people</span>, while programming languages also allow humans to communicate instructions to machines.</p>

        <h3>Abstractions</h3>
        <p class="black">Programming languages usually contain <span class="bold-italic">abstractions</span> for defining and manipulating data structures or controlling the flow of execution. The practical necessity that a programming language support adequate abstractions is expressed by <a href="#">the abstraction principle</a>. This principle is sometimes formulated as a <span class="highlight">recommendation to the programmer</span> to make proper use of such abstractions</p>
